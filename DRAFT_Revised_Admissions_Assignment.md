## WDI Admissions Assignment

Congratulations on making it to the second round of the admissions process for Web Development Immersive (WDI) at General Assembly!

In order to be successful in WDI, you really have to enjoy programming, and the only way to know that for sure is to try it. With that in mind, we’d like you to do some coding  - when you come in for your interview, we'll ask you about your experience with the project, and use it as a launching-off point for further discussion.

**In this assignment, you will be asked to:**

1. **[Complete some tutorials](#part1) in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**,
2. **[Set up your computer](#part2) to do some web development**,
3. **Use what you’ve learned from Dash to [build a simple website](#part3),** 
4. **Make your site live by [uploading it to kissr.com](#part4), and then,**
5. **Do some research on how the internet works and prepare to answer [the following questions](#part5) during your interview.**


We expect this assignment to take you approximately 10-15 hours. You should be prepared to talk through your code during the interview and share what outside resources you used, if any. If you get stuck, try to get through it on your own. If you’re **really** stuck, Google (and many other online resources) can help. Please let us know if you have any questions!

Here are your instructions:

###<a name="part1">(1) Complete Projects 1 - 5 in Dash</a>
Work through the tutorials on [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/). Please complete all five projects – these will teach you some of the basics of using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

###<a name="part2">(2) Set up your development environment</a>
First, watch [this 15-minute video](http://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/qzig8mp4mv) to learn how to set up a text editor on your computer and start writing your own HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. 

[Download Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and sign up for an account. Go to [www.kissr.com](http://kissr.com) and choose a unique domain name. When you hit "Try it!", use your Dropbox login credentials to link Kissr to Dropbox. 


###<a name="part3">(3) Build an “About Me” website</a>
Build a brand new single-page website for yourself using the HTML, CSS, and Javascript you learned from Dash. Place all your files inside the "App" folder that Kissr has created in your Dropbox.

Your site must use an external stylesheet (create a .css file, no inline styling!) but you may include your Javascript in your .html file if you prefer (so long as you keep it inside \<script>\</script> tags inside the \<head> section of your html file) rather than using an external .js file.

In addition, your site must include:

1. A \<section> telling us more about you and why you’re interested in the class.
2. An image of you in the center of the page, and two additional images with captions (one placed in the top right of your page, and one place in the bottom left).
3. An image carousel, with at least 3 images, that changes automatically every 2.5 seconds.
	
Here is some starter code for the image carousel for you to work with. Don’t change or delete anything written here, just read the comments and drop in your own code where it’s indicated. If you don’t understand what something means, go ahead and Google it!

####Javascript task one - event handlers

Create two buttons on your About Me page. Use some Javascript to make the following events occur: 

1. Displays an alert message when you click the first button. 
2. Changes the background color when your mouse hovers over the second button.

####Javascript task two - image carousel

```JAVASCRIPT
// HINT: Start with an array of image URLS, like the following:
// image_array = [“image1.jpg”,”image2.jpg”,”image3.jpg”]

// YOUR CODE HERE

window.timeout(2500) {
// HINT: To grab a particular HTML element and change one of
// its attributes, use JavaScript similar to the following:
	// document.getObjectByID(‘someID’).attribute = newValue

	// YOUR CODE HERE
}
```

Don't worry if your code isn't particularly fancy or polished - **focus on making something simple that works**. Of course, going above and beyond to impress us certainly won’t hurt! At the end of the day, though, what we want to see is your intellectual curiosity, resourcefulness, and creativity; during your interview, we'll discuss what you tried, where you got stuck, what you learned along the way, and ways that you'd continue to build out the site in the future. 

Once you’ve got your site to a point where you’re happy with it, move on to the last steps in this process.

###<a name="part4">(4) Check to see if your site is live on Kissr</a>
Go to your Kissr URL your_domain.kissr.com to see if your site is working. Make sure to email this url to admissions@generalassemb.ly so that we can access your site during the interview. 

###<a name="part5">(5) Understand how the internet works</a>

1. **What is an IP address?** 
2. **What is an HTTP GET request used for? What is an HTTP POST request used for?** 
3. **What is the HTTP response code for a successful request? A failed request?**
4. **What is the DOM?** 
5. **What is a cookie?**
